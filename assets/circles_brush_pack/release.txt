Circle Brushes Pack
(c) 2009 Echo Enduring Media

This brush pack contains 20 Illustrator brushes. The first 10 are circle scatter brushes, which you can use to make wicked patterns. Feel free to modify the parameters too! The other 10 are stacked lines, which were actually used to make the scatter brushes. 

As a bonus, the pack also includes the 10 shapes that I used to create the brushes.

These brushes and shapes are free for you to use for both personal and commercial works. I would appreciate credit wherever possible, and would love to see any creation or design that uses my creation.
